# Analysis of user behavior in a food product's sale mobile application

In the upcoming project, our task is to analyze the behavior of users in a food product's sale mobile application. We will analyze data that contains information about events that users made in the application, as well as examine the results of an A/A/B test conducted by marketers. Our research will include the following steps:

We will study the sales funnel.
Find out how users conduct a purchase.
Make an analysis of the number of users who made a purchase. Find out how many were eliminated on the previous steps, and on which particular steps.
Explore the results of the A/A/B experiment.
We will decide whether to stop or continue the experiment.
Draw conclusions based on the conducted study.

We were provided with a dataset with event’s data. The names of columns are following: the name of event, the dates on which it occurred, the identifiers of the devices which events has been made  and the group-id for A/A/B test.

At the end of the project we concluded that according to an analysis of the A / A / B test, there is no statistically significant difference between the three groups, the test can be stopped. The change made in an application  does not affect user’s behavior.

We used the following libraries for our project: pandas, numpy, math, seaborn, matplotlib, scipy, plotly.
